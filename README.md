# React-Weather-App

The weather app created using React and Vite leverages a weather API to provide real-time weather information. It features a simple and intuitive input box where users can enter the name of a location to search for its weather data. Upon entering a location, the app fetches and displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity e.t.c . This user-friendly interface allows for quick and easy access to weather updates for different places around the world.
